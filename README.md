1. Consider structuring your JavaScript abit more.
2. Don’t forget to ‘use strict’ in your JavaScript-document.
3. Try use consistant naming. You’ve mixed both camel and kebab-casing! (For example on “points-restart” and “restartMin”.
4. Don’t forget to add “loading: lazy” on your image-tags.
5. You have a document called “functions.js” that’s empty. Maybe remove that?
Overall a great game! The animations are really smooth and I love the basketball-court in the background. Good job getting both a click-counter and a timer implimented!
